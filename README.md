Using image classification algorithms on post-hurricane satellite photos to improve the efficiency of building damage assessment.

Damage assessment is crucial for emergency managers to respond quickly and allocate resources after a hurricane. The latest hurricane - Hurricane Iota, had 61 total fatalities, and 41 are still missing. Quantifying the number of flooded/damaged structures, which is generally done via ground survey, is one technique to measure the magnitude of the damage. This procedure can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.

In this problem, we suggest using image classification algorithms on post-hurricane satellite photos to improve the efficiency of building damage assessment. Each square-sized image contains a structure that can be rated as 'Damaged' (as determined by volunteers in a crowd-sourcing initiative) or 'Undamaged'.
